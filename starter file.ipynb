      "Great — Paris has so much to offer. A few quick questions to help tailor suggestions: How many days will you be there, and what do you like most (art, history, food, shopping, romance, families/kids, nightlife)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, here’s a compact guide to must-sees and choices by interest:\n",
      "\n",
      "Top iconic sights\n",
      "- Eiffel Tower — go up for views (book timed tickets) or enjoy picnic views on the Champ de Mars.\n",
      "- Louvre — world’s largest art museum (book a timed entry); don’t try to see everything — prioritize sections (Mona Lisa, Greek/Oriental antiquities).\n",
      "- Notre-Dame/Île de la Cité — the cathedral area and Sainte-Chapelle’s stained glass.\n",
      "- Arc de Triomphe & Champs-Élysées — climb the arch for a great view down the avenue.\n",
      "- Montmartre & Sacré-Cœur — cobbled streets, artists’ square, sunset views.\n",
      "- Musée d’Orsay — Impressionist masterpieces in a converted train station.\n",
      "- Seine river cruise — lovely at sunset; excellent orientation for first-time visitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neighborhoods worth exploring\n",
      "- Le Marais — boutiques, Jewish quarter falafel, trendy cafés, Musée Carnavalet and Picasso Museum.\n",
      "- Latin Quarter & Saint-Germain-des-Prés — narrow streets, bookshops (Shakespeare & Company), cafés, lively atmosphere.\n",
      "- Canal Saint‑Martin — relaxed cafés, good for a stroll or picnic.\n",
      "- Opéra / Grands Magasins — Galeries Lafayette & Printemps for shopping and rooftop views.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other museums & unique spots\n",
      "- Centre Pompidou — modern art + rooftop panorama.\n",
      "- Musée Rodin — sculpture garden (very pleasant).\n",
      "- Musée Picasso — excellent if you love Picasso.\n",
      "- Catacombs — macabre and popular; book ahead.\n",
      "- Musée de l’Orangerie — Monet’s Water Lilies.\n",
      "- Palais Garnier (Opéra) — grand interior tours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day trips\n",
      "- Palace of Versailles — gardens and Hall of Mirrors (allow a full day).\n",
      "- Giverny — Monet’s house and gardens (spring/summer).\n",
      "- Loire Valley castles or Champagne region if you want wine and châteaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips\n",
      "- Book timed tickets for major museums and the Eiffel Tower to avoid long lines.\n",
      "- Consider a Paris Museum Pass if you plan to visit many attractions.\n",
      "- Metro is fast and extensive; buy single tickets (t+) or a multi-day pass (Navigo or Paris Visite depending on length).\n",
      "- Watch for pickpockets in tourist areas and on crowded metro lines.\n",
      "- Many museums close one weekday — check opening days (e.g., Louvre closed Tuesday, Musée d’Orsay closed Monday).\n",
      "- Cash/credit: cards accepted widely; contactless payments are common.\n",
      "- Dining: try bakeries (croissant, pain au chocolat), cheese, charcuterie, bistros, and make reservations for popular restaurants. Tipping isn’t mandatory (service often included) but small extra is appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick sample itineraries\n",
      "- 1 day: Morning at Louvre, walk through Tuileries to Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées to Arc de Triomphe, late afternoon Eiffel Tower + Seine cruise at dusk.\n",
      "- 3 days: Day 1 — Louvre + Île de la Cité (Sainte-Chapelle), Latin Quarter; Day 2 — Musée d’Orsay + Saint‑Germain + Luxembourg Gardens + evening in Montmartre/Sacré‑Cœur; Day 3 — Le Marais + Centre Pompidou + Canal Saint‑Martin or Versailles day trip.\n",
      "- Family-friendly: Luxembourg Gardens playground, Cité des Sciences, Jardin d’Acclimatation, boat on the Seine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food suggestions\n",
      "- Café culture: sit and watch the world go by — try café crème, espresso.\n",
      "- Boulangerie: baguette and croissants.\n",
      "- Markets: Rue Cler or Marché Bastille for fresh produce and picnic supplies.\n",
      "- Sweet treats: macarons (Ladurée, Pierre Hermé), patisseries.\n",
      "- Regional dining: try a bistro for steak frites, a crêperie for savory crêpes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you tell me how long you’ll be in Paris and your main interests, I can draft a personalized day-by-day plan. Enjoy — Paris is best explored slowly and on foot when you can.\n"
