      "Nice — Paris has a lot to offer. A few quick questions so I can tailor recommendations: how many days will you be there, what are your main interests (art, food, history, architecture, shopping, kids), and do you want classic sights or hidden/locals’ spots?\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, here are high‑value suggestions, practical tips, and sample itineraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Top must-sees\n",
      "- Eiffel Tower — best seen at dusk (book tickets for summit or second floor in advance). Trocadéro offers great photo views.\n",
      "- Louvre — world’s largest art museum (Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo). Buy timed-entry tickets ahead, it’s closed Tuesdays.\n",
      "- Musée d’Orsay — Impressionist masterpieces in a former train station (closed Mondays).\n",
      "- Notre‑Dame & Île de la Cité — cathedral exterior (restoration ongoing), plus nearby Sainte‑Chapelle (stained glass).\n",
      "- Montmartre & Sacré‑Cœur — charming hilltop neighborhood, artists’ square, panoramic city views.\n",
      "- Champs‑Élysées & Arc de Triomphe — shopping and climb the Arc for a central view.\n",
      "- Le Marais — historic district, boutique shops, Jewish quarter, cafés, Picasso Museum.\n",
      "- Luxembourg Gardens — lovely park for relaxing, great for picnics.\n",
      "- Seine river cruise — especially pretty at sunset; hop-on/hop-off and dinner cruises available.\n",
      "- Centre Pompidou — modern art and rooftop views.\n",
      "- Musée Rodin & Musée de l’Orangerie — smaller but excellent, especially for Monet’s Water Lilies.\n",
      "- Père Lachaise Cemetery — graves of Jim Morrison, Oscar Wilde, and many others for a quieter stroll.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food & markets\n",
      "- Try croissants, baguette, cheese, charcuterie, macarons, and a café terrace for people-watching.\n",
      "- Markets: Marché d’Aligre, Rue Cler (near Eiffel), Marché Bastille (Sunday).\n",
      "- Bistro / brasserie for classic French dining; make reservations for popular places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips\n",
      "- Buy tickets for major attractions in advance (Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Sainte‑Chapelle).\n",
      "- Consider a Paris Museum Pass if you’ll visit many paid museums (saves time and money).\n",
      "- Use the metro — extensive and efficient. Get a carnet (10 tickets) or a Navigo pass if staying a week.\n",
      "- Watch out for pickpockets in crowded tourist areas and on public transport.\n",
      "- Many museums close one weekday (Louvre closed Tue, Orsay closed Mon); check opening days.\n",
      "- Best times: late spring and fall for mild weather and fewer crowds; early morning to beat lines.\n",
      "- Language: a few pleasantries in French go a long way (bonjour, s’il vous plaît, merci).\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick sample itineraries\n",
      "- 1 day (first-time): Morning — Louvre; Late morning — walk across Seine to Île de la Cité and Sainte‑Chapelle; Lunch in Latin Quarter; Afternoon — Musée d’Orsay or stroll Jardin du Luxembourg; Evening — Eiffel Tower at sunset and Seine cruise.\n",
      "- 3 days: Day 1 — Louvre, Tuileries, Champs‑Élysées & Arc de Triomphe; Day 2 — Montmartre & Sacré‑Cœur, then Le Marais; Day 3 — Musée d’Orsay, Latin Quarter, Notre‑Dame area and evening cruise or show (cabaret or jazz).\n",
      "- 5 days+: Add day trips to Versailles or Giverny, explore Canal Saint‑Martin, Musée Rodin, Père Lachaise, and shopping/food markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Off‑the‑beaten‑path ideas\n",
      "- Promenade Plantée / Coulée Verte — elevated greenway that inspired NYC’s High Line.\n",
      "- Canal Saint‑Martin — laid‑back cafés and bridges, popular with locals.\n",
      "- Petite Ceinture — old railway line in parts reclaimed by nature (limited access).\n",
      "- Visit Belleville for street art and panoramic city views without the crowds.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you tell me your travel dates, length of stay, and interests I’ll build a compact daily plan with timings, transit tips, and restaurant suggestions.\n"
