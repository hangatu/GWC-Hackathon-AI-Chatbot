      "Fantastic — Paris has a lot to offer. To make this useful quickly, here are (1) top highlights, (2) sample itineraries (1- and 3-day), (3) food & practical tips, and (4) a few safety/ticket notes. Tell me how many days you have and what you like (art, food, history, shopping, kids) and I’ll customize it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Top sights (don’t miss)\n",
      "- Eiffel Tower (book timed tickets; or enjoy the view from Trocadéro or Champ de Mars)\n",
      "- Louvre Museum (book ahead; closed Tuesdays)\n",
      "- Musée d’Orsay (Impressionists; closed Mondays)\n",
      "- Notre‑Dame area & Île de la Cité (cathedral restoration ongoing, but the island and Sainte‑Chapelle are beautiful)\n",
      "- Sainte‑Chapelle (stunning stained glass)\n",
      "- Montmartre & Sacré‑Cœur (great views, artists’ square)\n",
      "- Arc de Triomphe & Champs‑Élysées\n",
      "- Le Marais (Place des Vosges, boutiques, Jewish quarter)\n",
      "- Luxembourg Gardens & Latin Quarter\n",
      "- Seine cruise (Bateaux Mouches) — lovely at dusk\n",
      "- Pompidou Centre (modern art and great view)\n",
      "- Musée Rodin / Musée de l’Orangerie (Monet’s Water Lilies)\n",
      "- Catacombs (book in advance) or Père Lachaise cemetery\n",
      "- Day trips: Versailles (palace & gardens), Giverny (Monet’s garden), Disneyland Paris\n",
      "\n",
      "Sample 1-day itinerary (first-time visitor)\n",
      "- Morning: Eiffel Tower / Trocadéro photos\n",
      "- Late morning: Seine stroll to Louvre (quick visit or photo outside)\n",
      "- Lunch: Latin Quarter bistro\n",
      "- Afternoon: Île de la Cité, Sainte‑Chapelle, then Notre‑Dame area and walk to Sainte‑Chapelle\n",
      "- Evening: Seine cruise at sunset or Montmartre + Sacré‑Cœur for night views\n",
      "\n",
      "Sample 3-day itinerary\n",
      "- Day 1: Louvre (half–full day), Tuileries/Gardens, Musée de l’Orangerie, walk Champs‑Élysées to Arc de Triomphe\n",
      "- Day 2: Musée d’Orsay, Latin Quarter, Sainte‑Chapelle, evening Seine cruise\n",
      "- Day 3: Versailles (half or full day) OR Montmartre, Le Marais, Pompidou, and shopping\n",
      "\n",
      "Food & drink tips\n",
      "- Try: baguette, croissant, pain au chocolat, cheese, charcuterie, steak‑frites, confit de canard, crêpes, macarons.\n",
      "- Classic spots: boulangeries (buy fresh), local bistros (look for daily specials), patisseries (Pierre Hermé, Ladurée, or a small local one).\n",
      "- Dinner times are later than some countries — many restaurants open around 7–7:30 pm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips\n",
      "- Transport: Metro + buses are efficient. Buy single tickets, a carnet (10 trips), or a Navigo weekly pass if staying 7+ days. Use RER for suburbs (Versailles/Charles de Gaulle).\n",
      "- Buy timed-entry tickets online for Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Versailles, Catacombs.\n",
      "- Museums: check closures (Louvre closed Tue, Musée d’Orsay closed Mon).\n",
      "- Language: English is common in tourist areas; learning a few French phrases (bonjour, s’il vous plaît, merci) is appreciated.\n",
      "- Currency: euro. Cards accepted almost everywhere; keep small change for markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety & money-saving\n",
      "- Watch for pickpockets in crowded tourist areas and on the metro; keep valuables secure.\n",
      "- Beware of common scams (fake petitions, “ring” bracelet hustles, distraction thefts).\n",
      "- Consider a Museum Pass if you plan to visit many sites (can save time and money).\n",
      "- Check for strikes/closures — occasionally affect transport and museums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accessibility & timing\n",
      "- Expect steps in many historic sites; check accessibility if needed.\n",
      "- Spring and fall are ideal for fewer crowds; summer is busy but lively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Want a personalized plan? Tell me:\n",
      "- How many days you have\n",
      "- Your interests (art, food, shopping, history, families)\n",
      "- Any mobility/budget considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll build a tailored itinerary with timed tickets and dining suggestions.\n"
